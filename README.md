[TOC]

## Overview

This is the official SDK that helps third party developers to write apps to manipulate 3D cameras of Shining3D's 2X series.

It runs as a standalone executable and communicates with 3rd apps via ZMQ. The interfaces try to keep consistent with the latest EXScan ProÂ®, the official controlling software of 2X series cameras.

## Installation

The SDK consists of only two files:

- Sn3DPlatform.exe: the main executable of the SDK.
- platform.ini: the configuration file.

The executable cannot run alone. It has dependencies of the controlling software. Therefore, these two files have to be put into the root directory of EXScan Pro installation path, i.e. in the same directory of EXScanPro.exe.

## Configuration & run

Currently there are only two parameters in platform.ini in version v1.0:

- `Pub`: the publish url of ZMQ. Default is `tcp://*:11398`.
- `Rep`: the request url of ZMQ. Default is `tcp://*:11399`.

Normally you only need to change the ports if you want.

Double click Sn3DPlatform.exe and then the SDK is ready to talk to you via ZMQ interfaces.

## Interfaces

Each message between Sn3DPlatform.exe and your app consists of two frames:

- Envelop: An ASCII string with a maximum length of 255. It contains two parts: 
  - Version: the version of this message. Currently only `"v1.0"` is supported.
  - Commands: the actual commands of this message. The commands may have several parts, who are joined by character `/`.
- Payload: A byte array with a maximum length of 1024. It could be an integer, a string, or a JSON object, depending on the certain command.

The heartbeat message is a special message publishing from the SDK. It has only the evelop. Third party app should pay attention if they receive a message with such envelop.

There are three types of interfaces:

- **Publish**: The publish messages are published automatically by SDK when the corresponding properties are changed.
- **Request Get**: Third apps use this interface to get certain value from the device with a REQ/REP pattern.
- **Request Set**: Third apps use this interface to set certain value on the device with a REQ/REP pattern.

To receive all the publish messages, you should connect to the `Pub` url. To do Req/Rep communication to the SDK, you should connect and send/receive data to the `Rep` url.

The payload has different types:

- **Int Bool**: integar with 4 bytes, 0 means `false`, 1 measn `true;
- **Int**: signed integar with 4 bytes;
- **Int LL**: signed longlong integar with 8 bytes;
- **String**: C-style string;
- **JSON**: JSON object.

### Heartbeat

This is a publish message broadcasted by the SDK repeatedly to indicate the main SDK process is still alive.

| Type    | Envelop | Payload |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Publish | v1.0/hb | None    |

The interval of heartbeat is 1 seconds currently. Third app who cares about the aliveness of SDK could moniter the heartbeat. If no heartbeat comes any more, the main SDK process should be dead and needs relaunching.

### Asynchronous actions

Many actions on the device take time to perform. To inform the third party apps the current status of the actions, the SDK broadcasts three messages/signals:

- **The beginning messages**: indicating that the action has begun.
- **The progress messages**: telling how far the action has gone. The progress value is between 0 and 100. It is ideal for developers to bind the value to a visual progress bar. Note: some actions don't have this kind of messages.
- **The finishing messages**: signaling that the action has finished.

| Type    | Envelop                | Payload |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Publish | v1.0/beginAsyncAction  | JSON    |
| Publish | v1.0/progress          | Int     |
| Publish | v1.0/finishAsyncAction | JSON    |

All the asynchronous actions are listed below:

- `"AAT_CHECK_DEVICE"`: Check the device.
- `"AAT_ENTER_CALI"`: Enter the calibration state.
- `"AAT_CHANGE_CALI_TYPE"`: Change the calibration type.
- `"AAT_EXIT_CALI"`: Exit the calibration state.
- `"AAT_COMPUTE_CALI"`: Compute the calibration.
- `"AAT_NEW_PROJECT"`: Create a new project.
- `"AAT_OPEN_PROJECT"`: Open the specified project.
- `"AAT_ENTER_SCAN"`: Enter the scanning state.
- `"AAT_EXIT_SCAN"`: Exit the scanning state.
- `"AAT_CANCEL_SCAN"`: Cancel the current scanning.
- `"AAT_END_SCAN"`: Finish the current scanning.

- `"AAT_MESH"`: Start warping/meshing the point cloud.
- `"AAT_SIMPLIFY"`: Simplify the current scanned model.
- `"AAT_EDIT"`: Edit the current model.
- `"AAT_EDIT_LIST"`: Edit the data list for the current scanning project.
- `"AAT_DEL_POINT_CLOUD"`: Delete certain point cloud.
- `"AAT_SAVE"`: Save the current scanned model to the project.
- `"AAT_FIX_SINGLE_EDIT"`: Edit a single patch of point cloud in fix scan mode.
- `"AAT_AXIS_VERIFY"`: Compute & adjust the turnable axis.
- `"AAT_FIX_SCAN"`: Broadcast current state in fix scan mode.
- `"AAT_FIX_REMOVE_DATA"`: Remove data in fix scan mode.
- `"AAT_FIX_UPDATE_DATA_RT"`: Update the RT matrix in fix scan mode.
- `"AAT_EXPORT_SHARE_DATA"`: Export shared data.

The beginning JSON format is below:

```json
{
    "type": "AAT_CHECK_DEVICE",
    "props": {}
}
```

The `props` differs between different actions. It will be explained in detail under the corresponding action interface later.

The finishing JSON format is below:

```json
{
    "type": "AAT_CHECK_DEVICE",
    "result":{
        "success": false,
        "error": 2,
        "detail": "Cannot connect to the device."
    },
    "props": {}
}
```

The `props` differs between different actions. It will be explained in detail under the corresponding action interface later.

### Shared memory

Messages through ZMQ are commands, signals or small data. It is not feasible to transfer large data through ZMQ since it involves redundant copying. We use shared memories to transfer large data.

There are 6 different types of large data transferring via shared memories currently:

- `"MT_POINT_CLOUD"`: Point cloud captured by the device and sent to apps.
- `"MT_DELETE_POINTS"`: Indices of points that need deleting. It is sent from apps to the device.
- `"MT_MARKERS"`: The positions information of markers captured by the device and sent to apps.
- `"MT_TRI_MESH"`: Triangle mesh information sent from the device to apps.
- `"MT_VIDEO_DATA"`: Video streaming sent from the device to apps.
- `"MT_RANGE_DATA"`: Single frame data with depth information sent from device to apps in fix mode only.

To receive shared memories, you need to do the following steps:

1. Setup a new `ZMQ_REQ` type ZMQ socket, and bind to a url.
2. Register to the SDK by calling `v1.0/scan/register` and send the url. It should be done before the scanning, otherwise data might be lost.
3. Wait for requesting from the SDK with the key and type of the shared memory.
4. Open the shared memory using language-specific manner and analyzing the data.
5. Reply the SDK with Int Bool `true` if you sucessfully handle the data, `false` otherwise.
6. Finish analyzing. Return to Step 3, waiting for the next large data.

Related interfaces are:

| Type    | Envelop              | Payload |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| Request | v1.0/scan/register   | String  |
| Request | v1.0/scan/unregister | String  |

The message sent from SDK to the app contains JSON with the information (key and type) of the shared memory. It has no envelop. The JSON definition is below:

```json
{
    "type": "MT_POINT_CLOUD",	// The data type
    "key": "qtipc_XXXXXXXXXX",	// The native shared memory key
    "name": "currentPointCloud",// The name of current data
    "offset": 100,				// The offset from the beginning of the data (bytes)
    "props":{}					// type-specific parameters
}
```

#### Open from other languages

The key is a native mapped file descriptor on Windows. You can use corresponding functions in your favorite language to open and manipulate it. For example, in Python, the shared memory can be opend like this:

```python
import mmap
shm = mmap.mmap(0, 512, 'qtipc_XXXXXXXXXX')
```

Then you can use member functions of `mmap` to read/write the shared memory.

In C#, the same thing can be done like this:

```c#
using System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles;
MemoryMappedFile mm = MemoryMappedFile.OpenExisting(@"qtipc_XXXXXXXXXX", 
                                                    MemoryMappedFileRights.ReadWrite);
using(var accessor = mm.CreateViewAccessor(0, 512)){
    // read/write using accessor
}
```

#### Properties and structures on the shared memory

Different data types have different props and structures.

##### Point cloud related data

For `MT_POINT_CLOUD`, `MT_MARKERS`, `MT_RANGE_DATA` and `MT_TRI_MESH`, the props definition is:

```json
{
    "pointCount": 1000,		// The number of points
    "hasTexture": false,	// Whether there is texture attribute for each point
    "hasNormal": true,		// Whether there is normal attribute for each point
    "incremental": true,	// Whether this data is incremental to the last data
    "hasMarkers": true,		// Whether this data contains markers
    "haveUsed": false,		// [Todo]
    "hasTexturePicture": false,// [Todo]
    "faceCount": 500,		// The number of triangles
    "textureImgWidth": 512,	// The width of texture image
    "textureImgHeight": 512,// The height of texture image
    "textureUVCount": 1000,	// [Todo]
    "hasFaceNormal": true,	// Whether there is normal attribute for each triangle
    "packID": 0,			// Current package index, used for data segmentation
    "totalPacks": 10		// Total package count, used for data segmentation
}
```

There are 8 different named shared memories currently:

- `"currentPointCloud"`: Current frame of point cloud.
- `"currentMarker"`: Current frame of markers.
- `"wholePointCloud"`: The whole point cloud.
- `"failedPointCloud"`: Current frame of point cloud that cannot be aligned to existing points.
- `"frameMarkerPoint"`: Global marker file information.
- `"wholeMarkerPoint"`: The whole markers information.
- `"meshData"`: The triangle mesh data.
- `"rangeData"`: One frame of point cloud data in fix mode.

For `currentPointCloud`, `failedPointCloud` and `wholePointCloud`, the structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are:

![image-20190305134521330](assets/image-20190305134521330.png)

If `hasNormal` is `false`, then the normal part will be missing. If `hasTexture` is false, then the color part will be missing. If `incremental` is false, the id part will be missing.

The id is integer with 4 bytes, and the others are all float with 8 bytes.

For non-incremental `wholePointCloud`(the `incremental` property is `false` of its props), the complete data may be divided into`totalPacks` packages, and `packID` denotes the current package index. Developers should gather all the packages before processing the whole data.

For `currentMarker`, `frameMarkerPoint` and `wholeMarkerPoint`, the structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are:

![image-20190305135736480](assets/image-20190305135736480.png)

For `meshData`, since the data is too large, it is sent via 4 sequential units, each of which may consist of several packages (`totalPacks` is larger than 1):

1.  Vertices unit. If `pointCount` is non-zero, this unit delivers the vertices. The structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are almost the same as point cloud except the absence of `id`:
   ![image-20190305144233650](assets/image-20190305144233650.png)
   If `hasNormal` is `false`, then the normal part will be missing. If `hasTexture` is false, then the color part will be missing. If `incremental` is false, the id part will be missing.
2. Texture image unit. If `hasTexturePicture` is `true`, this unit delivers the texture image. The image has `textureImgWidth * textureImgHeight` pixels, each of which is 3 bytes of RGB.
3. Triangles unit. If `faceCount` is non-zero, this unit delivers the indexed triangles.  The structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are:
   ![image-20190305145018407](assets/image-20190305145018407.png)
   If `hasTexturePicture` is false, then the part of texture uv index will be absent.
4. Texture UV unit. If `textureUVCount` is non-zero, this unit delivers the texture UV coordinates. The structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are:
   ![image-20190305145349778](assets/image-20190305145349778.png)

After receving the 4 units, developers can put them togather and analyze/render the triangle mesh.

For `rangeData`, the structures on the shared memory starting at offset `offset` are:

![image-20190306165918507](assets/image-20190306165918507.png)

If `hasNormal` is `false`, then the normal part will be missing. If `hasTexture` is false, then the color part will be missing. If `incremental` is false, the id part will be missing.

`rotation` is a 3x3 column-major matrix, and `translation` is a 3-element vector.

##### Video data

For `MT_VIDEO_DATA`, the props definition is:

```json
{
    "width": 512,	// Image width
    "height": 512,	// Image height
    "rotation": 90,	// The rotation angle (in degree)
    "channel": 1	// The channel number for each pixel
}
```

If `channel` is 1, it means that it is a grey image; if `channel` is 3, it means that it is a colorful image coming from the texture camera, and each pixel contains RGB 3 bytes.

There are 4 different named shared memories currently:

- `"cam0"`: The 1st camera.
- `"cam1"`: The 2nd camera.
- `"cam2"`: The 3rd camera.
- `"cam3"`: The 4th camera.

To render the images correctly, developers should rotate the images counterclockwise with the degree of `rotation`.
